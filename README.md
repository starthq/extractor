# StartHQ Extractor API

The [StartHQ web app directory](https://starthq.com/apps/) provides info such as the speed of the app, its popularity, reliability, related news and recent blog posts. We've been asked by a number of people to add various bits of information to the app profile pages, such as the summary of apps' ToS, availability of mobile apps etc. As developers ourselves, we know that it is often easier to write code than explain what we want, so we've decided to share our internal APIs in the hope that you would write the code needed to pull in the data you want yourself. In return, we will give you full access to all the data that we collect & make displaying the information you need a priority.

## Overview

The directory is kept automatically up to date with API integrations, which are implemented via "extractors". Extractors are CommonJS modules that typically use the synchronous Common Node [httpclient](http://olegp.github.io/common-node/doc/httpclient/index.html) interface for making HTTP requests.

This repo is a sample extractor that you can fork to implement your own. We will run your extractor on our infrastructure against the directory, include the data it provides on the app pages, and give it back to you via a RESTful API. You can use this data wherever you want, but please do link back to us.

Some ideas for extractors include:

- an extractor that checks whether the given web app is available as a native mobile app in a store such as Google Play Market
- an extractor that identifies which infrastructure provider the web app uses, e.g. Amazon, Azure, App Engine etc.
- an extractor that uses the Twitter API to list all popular tweets about the app

For more ideas, check out the [StartHQ Roadmap](http://starthq.uservoice.com).

## Setup

First make sure you have Node.js installed from [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org). NPM should be bundled with Node, so use that to install [Common Node](http://olegp.github.io/common-node/) with `npm install common-node -g` (you may need to prefix that with `sudo` on Mac and Linux).

Fork this repo by clicking the "Fork" button in the upper right of this page, then clone your fork with `git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/extractor.git` (substituting your username for USERNAME) then change to the project directory with `cd extractor`.

To run, simply type `common-node index.js`

## API

The extractor modules export a single method that accepts two parameters:

- app - is the app object which contains at least the `name` and `url` attributes that are the app name and index page URL respectively; the app object also contains data retrieved by all the other extractors, see the [`app.json`](./app.json) example file.
- config - this is the optional configuration object which may for example be an API key needed to make API requests by the extractor


```javascript
var HttpClient = require("httpclient").HttpClient;

module.exports = function(app, config) {
  return new HttpClient({url:app.url}).finish().body.read().length;
};
```

## Presentation

The way in which the information provided by the extractors is presented on the app profile pages varies. For example the Web of Trust reputation scores are compared to the other scores in the database and displayed as a five star rating.
Other data such as news posts are displayed as a series of links to stories below the app description.

To accommodate more information, we will be adding tabs below the description, so if you want you can include some sample HTML for us to use to display the data provided by your extractor. Please use the [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) framework for styling your HTML.

## Examples

Some example extractors are included in the `examples` subdirectory:

- wot - uses the [Web of Trust API](http://www.mywot.com/wiki/API)

## Dependencies

If your extractor has dependencies other than Common Node, please include an NPM compatible package.json file. To avoid proliferation of dependencies, we recommend using the following packages for some standard tasks:

- [xml2js](https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/node-xml2js) - for parsing XML

## Support

If you run into any problems or want to let us know about your extractor so we can merge it in, either create an issue under this repo, or e-mail us at developers@starthq.com

## License

__Note that you need to retain this license with an updated copyright line in your fork in order for us to be able to run your extractor.__
